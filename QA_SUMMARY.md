- Error responses proper format
- SQL injection prevented
- XSS sanitized
- Database integrity maintained
- Concurrent requests safe
- API response < 5 seconds

**Key Validation**: Backend stable and secure ✅

## Part 4: Validation & QA Results

### Bug Fix Validation

#### B1: Worker Error Handler ✅
- **Test**: `api.spec.ts` → "Database operations maintain integrity"
- **Validation**: Worker captures jobId before try block
- **Result**: Failed jobs correctly update DB status to "failed"
- **Impact**: No more stuck jobs; accurate error reporting

#### B2: Upload Init Race Condition ✅
- **Test**: `upload.spec.ts` → "Upload init creates job record"
- **Validation**: Job exists in database before presign response
- **Result**: All uploads tracked with correct user ID
- **Impact**: Quota system reliable; no job loss

#### B3: Download Authorization ✅
- **Test**: `download.spec.ts` → "Download endpoint requires user ownership"
- **Validation**: Different user gets 403; same user succeeds
- **Result**: Cross-user access prevented
- **Impact**: User data isolated; security improved

### SDK Upgrade Validation ✅

All API calls tested and working:
- ✅ `whopApi.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass()`
- ✅ `whopApi.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany()`
- ✅ `whopApi.oauth.exchangeCode()`
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing code

### Browser Coverage ✅

Tests run on:
- ✅ Chrome (Desktop)
- ✅ Firefox (Desktop)
- ✅ Safari (Desktop)
- ✅ Edge (Desktop)
- ✅ Chrome Mobile (375px viewport)
- ✅ Safari Mobile (iPhone 12)

### Security Validation ✅

- ✅ XSS attempts sanitized
- ✅ User ownership enforced
- ✅ Webhook signatures validated
- ✅ CORS headers correct
